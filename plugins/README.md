# Blossom plugins

## Information

I see you are interested in plugins for this project. Glad to hear that! Or if not and you just wonder why this folder exists I will answer both of your questions shortly.

## FAQ

- Does any plugin require another plugin to work?
  - Yes, some plugin requires one or more plugins to work and this is displayed in the corresponding repository.
- Does any plugin exist at the moment?
  - No, no plugin exists at the moment as I want to improve the base product first.
- Are any plugins included by default?
  - No, no plugins are included by default in the core and base project as I want this to be as basic as possible and then let users customize it to their needs. I hate it when apps include a lot of plugins (mostly AI :O) and there is no way to disable the features; so here we don't ship them at all and let the users download only the additions they like.
- Do you personally use more plugins than one?
  - Yes, I use most of these plugins myself in my local copy but even I don't use all of them.
- Can I help with the development?
  - Yes, please feel free to contribute with whatever you feel like doing. Everything from better documentation to large contributions with code or branding is gladly appreciated. You can even suggest more plugins and help me develop them.
